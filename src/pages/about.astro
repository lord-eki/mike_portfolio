  <p>
    I am a passionate and versatile educator with expertise in French language,
    Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and public speaking
    coaching.
  </p>
  <p>
    With over 7 years of teaching experience, I am dedicated to helping learners
    develop not just academic skills, but also the confidence and communication
    abilities they need to thrive in todayâ€™s world.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a French teacher, I focus on making the language accessible and
    enjoyable, blending grammar, culture, and conversation to create an
    immersive learning experience. As an ICT educator, I empower students with
    digital skills, encouraging creativity, problem-solving, and responsible
    technology use in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

  <p>
    In my role as a public speaking coach, I work with students, professionals,
    and aspiring speakers to build their confidence, clarity, and presence.
    Whether preparing for presentations, interviews, or public engagements, I
    provide practical tools and personalized feedback to help each individual
    speak with impact.

  <p>
    At the core of all my work is a belief in the power of education,
    communication, and lifelong learning.
